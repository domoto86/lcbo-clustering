## Wine Dashboard Web Application 

This web application utilizes Flask to offer users a Wine Dashboard, enabling them to explore and filter a diverse range of wine data. The data is sourced from a CSV file, extracted from an online website and includes details about different wines, such as their categories, clusters, and unique attributes. Users have the flexibility to apply filters based on various columns, empowering them to discover wines that align with their specific preferences.
